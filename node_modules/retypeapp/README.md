# Retype - Write anything

[Retype](https://retype.com/) is an :sparkles: ultra-high-performance :sparkles: generator that builds a website based on simple text files. Focus on your writing while Retype builds the rest.

No coding is required and just one Markdown file, such as a [`README.md`](https://www.makeareadme.com/), will get you started.

> The [retype.com](https://retype.com/) website was generated using Retype.

A new Retype powered website can be up and running within seconds once Retype is installed, which itself takes only a few seconds. :+1:

## Quick start

You [install](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/) Retype using [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/), or the [`dotnet`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) CLI.

From your command line, navigate to a folder location where you have one or more Markdown `.md` files, such as a GitHub or GitLab project.

Next, choose one of the following tools to first install `retypeapp` and then start Retype by using the [`retype watch`](https://retype.com/guides/cli/#retype-watch) command:

### NPM

```
npm install retypeapp --global
retype watch
```

### Yarn

```
yarn global add retypeapp
retype watch
```

### dotnet

```
dotnet tool install retypeapp --global
retype watch
```

That's it! Your new Retype website should be up and running.

## Features

#### :tada: It just works

Retype has been built to be easy to use and should _"just work"_ out-of-the-box without any special configuration or troublesome setup.

#### :zap: Lightning fast

Don't blink. Retype was built for speed.

#### :white_check_mark: Easy install

[Installation](https://retype.com/guides/getting-started/) takes only a few seconds. Then you need at least one Markdown `.md` file which Retype will start building a new website from.

#### :muscle: Powerful

Project level [configuration](https://retype.com/configuration/project/) using `retype.yml` unlocks many more Retype features and customization.

#### :pencil2: Simple formatting

Pages are [formatted](https://retype.com/guides/formatting/) using Markdown syntax and Retype [components](https://retype.com/components/). Page level [configuration](https://retype.com/configuration/page/) is available, such as customizing the navigation [`label`](https://retype.com/configuration/page/#label) or [`description`](https://retype.com/configuration/page/#description) used by search engines.

#### :arrows_clockwise: Live reload

If a change is detected, such as editing and saving an `.md` file, your Retype website will be updated almost instantly within the browser. After running [`retype watch`](https://retype.com/guides/cli/#retype-watch), edit any `.md` file and see your changes appear in the browser almost instantly.

#### :computer: Host anywhere

Retype generates a basic HTML website that you can self-host on any web hosting service, such as [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/). No special server-side software or external dependencies are required. You can host your Retype site as a public website or as a private website inside your organization.
